# PromotionAnalysis
1. **Project Overview:** Conducted in-depth analysis of the Google Merchandise Store's promotions and user engagement during the period from August 1st to October 1st, 2023.

2. **Promotion Analysis:** Analyzed the effectiveness of promotions, including "Aloha," "Calling all YouTube fans," "Sip, sip, hooray!," "Happy pets ahead," and "Adventure awaits."

3. **Chart Creation:** Utilized free-form and path exploration techniques to create visualizations, including charts showcasing promotion views and clicks.

4. **View vs. Click Analysis:** Identified that while "Aloha" received the highest views, clicks were notably lower, highlighting the need for enhancing click-through rates.

5. **User Engagement:** Explored user engagement paths, revealing that most users viewed promotions and scrolled the page but only a small percentage proceeded to make a purchase.

6. **Key Insights:** Discovered that a sale announcement on Google's 25th Birthday led to a spike in both views and clicks, indicating the significance of timely promotions.

7. **Recommendations:** Proposed improvements to increase user engagement, such as modifying the promotion screen layout to ensure all promotions are visible at once and adding discount information to encourage users to click and make purchases.

8. **Creativity and Data Analysis:** Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and drawing actionable insights from the data.
